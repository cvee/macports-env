# Use compression of the slave/master protocol if both the slave and the 
# master support it

# Enable binary logging
log-bin = /opt/local/var/log/mysql5/mysql-bin

# Index file for binary log file names
log-bin-index = /opt/local/var/log/mysql5/mysql-bin.index

# Synchronize the binary log to disk after every write
sync_binlog = 1

# Tell the slave to log the updates performed by its SQL thread to its own
# binary log
log-slave-updates = 1

# Cause the slave to allow no updates except from slave threads or from users
# having the SUPER privilege

# Basename for the relay log
relay-log = /opt/local/var/log/mysql5/mysql-relay-bin

# Name to use for the relay log index file
relay-log-index = /opt/local/var/log/mysql5/mysql-relay-bin.index

# Name to use for the file in which the slave records information about the
# relay logs
relay-log-info-file = /opt/local/var/log/mysql5/relay-log.info

# Host name or IP address of the slave to be reported to the master during
# slave registration
report-host = <hostname>

# To configure this host as a replication slave, you can choose between
# two methods:
#
# 1) Use the CHANGE MASTER TO command (fully described in our manual)
#    the syntax is:
#
#    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST=<host>, MASTER_PORT=<port>,
#    MASTER_USER=<user>, MASTER_PASSWORD=<password> ;
#
#    where you replace <host>, <user>, <password> by quoted strings and
#    <port> by the master's port number (3306 by default).
#
#    Example:
#
#    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='125.564.12.1', MASTER_PORT=3306,
#    MASTER_USER='joe', MASTER_PASSWORD='secret';
#
# 2) Set the variables below. However, in case you choose this method, then
#    start replication for the first time (even unsuccessfully, for example
#    if you mistyped the password in master-password and the slave fails to
#    connect), the slave will create a master.info file, and any later
#    change in this file to the variables' values below will be ignored and
#    overridden by the content of the master.info file, unless you shutdown
#    the slave server, delete master.info and restart the slaver server.
#    For that reason, you may want to leave the lines below untouched
#    (commented) and instead use CHANGE MASTER TO (see above)
#
# Host name or IP address of the master replication server (Required)
master-host = 127.0.0.1
#
# User name of the account that the slave thread uses for authentication when
# it connects to the master (Required)
master-user = replicant
#
# Password of the account the slave uses for authentication when it connects
# to the master (Required)
master-password = <password>
#
# TCP/IP port number that the master is listening on (Optional)
# Default: 3306
master-port = 3306
